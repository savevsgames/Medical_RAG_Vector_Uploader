# üì¶ Medical RAG Vector Uploader - Technical Breakdown

## üéØ Core Purpose
This application serves as a secure platform for processing medical documents into vector embeddings for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications. It combines document processing, vector embedding generation, and secure storage with granular access controls.

## üèó Architecture Deep Dive

### Frontend Architecture
- **React + Vite**: Optimized for development speed and production performance
- **Component Structure**:
  - `FileUpload`: Handles drag-and-drop file uploads with type validation
  - `DocumentList`: Displays uploaded documents with metadata
  - `Login`: Manages user authentication flow
- **State Management**: Local React state for UI, Supabase for data persistence
- **Authentication Flow**: JWT-based auth through Supabase, tokens stored in localStorage

### Backend Architecture (FastAPI)
- **Core Components**:
  - `DocumentProcessor`: Extracts text from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
  - `BioBERTEmbedder`: Generates 768-dimensional vectors using BioBERT
  - `SupabaseClient`: Handles storage and database operations
- **Security Layer**: JWT verification for protected endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Document Upload Flow
1. User drops file in `FileUpload` component
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. File sent to FastAPI backend with JWT
4. Backend:
   - Verifies JWT and extracts user_id
   - Processes document through DocumentProcessor
   - Generates embedding via BioBERTEmbedder
   - Stores file in Supabase Storage
   - Saves metadata and embedding in documents table
5. Frontend updates UI with success/error

### Vector Search Flow
1. Query text converted to embedding
2. Similarity search using pgvector
3. Results filtered by relevance threshold
4. Metadata returned to frontend

## üóÉ Database Design

### documents Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  filename text NOT NULL,
  content text,
  metadata jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  embedding vector(768),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Security Policies
- Public read access for AI inference
- Write operations restricted to authenticated users
- Delete operations limited to document owners

### Indexing Strategy
```sql
CREATE INDEX documents_embedding_idx 
ON documents 
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
WITH (lists = 100);
```

## üîê Security Architecture

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth handles user management
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Token verification on backend endpoints

### Authorization
- Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- User-specific document ownership tracking
- Public read access for AI operations

### File Security
- Secure file storage in Supabase Storage
- Access controlled through signed URLs
- File type validation on upload

## üîç Vector Search Implementation

### Embedding Generation
- BioBERT model for medical domain specificity
- 768-dimensional vectors
- Batch processing capability

### Similarity Search
- Cosine similarity via pgvector
- IVFFlat index for performance
- Configurable similarity threshold

## üöÄ Deployment Architecture

### Backend (Render)
- Containerized FastAPI application
- Environment variables for configuration
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

### Frontend (Vercel)
- Static site deployment
- Environment variable injection
- API URL configuration

### Database (Supabase)
- Postgres with pgvector extension
- Automated backups
- Connection pooling

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Vector Search Optimization

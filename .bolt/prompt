We have built a companion app for doctors to connect to the TxAgent Container.

- We are currently integrating new back-end features for the new USER PORTAL expo application that lets users chat with the TxAgent embeddings just like this app lets doctors, but also includes their user specific information and calls a different endpoint. 

The Plan
To correctly handle the different types of consultations (doctor vs. patient) and route to the appropriate AI model while incorporating relevant context, you should make the following changes:

Modify hybrid-agent/routes/medical_consultation.py:

File: hybrid-agent/routes/medical_consultation.py
Change: Update the MedicalConsultationRequest Pydantic model to include an optional preferred_agent: Optional[str] = Field(default="txagent", description="Preferred AI agent for consultation (txagent or openai)").
Change: In the medical_consultation endpoint function, pass the request.preferred_agent and the entire request.context object (which may contain user_profile or just conversation_history) to the chat_with_documents function call.
Modify hybrid-agent/routes/chat.py:

File: hybrid-agent/routes/chat.py
Change: Update the chat_with_documents function signature to accept preferred_agent: str = "txagent" and context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None.
Change: Inside chat_with_documents, implement conditional logic based on preferred_agent:
If preferred_agent == "txagent": Proceed with the existing logic of generating an embedding for the query and performing a search_relevant_documents call. Then, pass the query, relevant_docs, history (from context), and the user_profile (if present in context) to the generate_chat_response function.
If preferred_agent == "openai": Skip the embedding generation and document search steps. Directly call generate_chat_response with the query, an empty list for context_docs, the history (from context), and the user_profile (if present in context).
Change: Ensure chat_with_documents returns the agent_id that was actually used (e.g., "txagent" or "openai").
Change: Refine the generate_chat_response function signature to accept query: str, context_docs: List[Dict[str, Any]], history: List[Dict[str, Any]], user_profile: Optional[Dict[str, Any]], and preferred_agent: str.
Change: Within generate_chat_response, dynamically construct the system prompt for the LLM.
If user_profile is present, include it in the prompt to personalize the response (for patient queries).
If context_docs are provided, include them as RAG context.
Adjust the persona/instructions based on whether user_profile is present (e.g., "You are a medical AI assistant providing personalized advice based on the user's profile and documents" vs. "You are a medical AI assistant providing general information based on documents").
Change: Implement the actual OpenAI API call within generate_chat_response. This function will be responsible for making the axios or openai library call to OpenAI's chat completions API, using the constructed prompt and the OPENAI_API_KEY.
These changes will allow the TxAgent container to intelligently adapt its behavior based on the source of the request (doctor vs. patient) and the user's preferred AI model, ensuring secure and contextually relevant responses.

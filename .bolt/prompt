i dont know if the front end is properly updated to match the new backed? 

I load into the root (because loading /chat still fails and does not exist even though we added the _redirects and updated render with /*   index.html    200)

Then i go to the monitor page and try to activate the agent  connection - even though the container was on, and i get this (image)

--------------------------

WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING. 

THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE IN WHAT WE THINK THE CONTAINER DOES. 

IT IS DESIGNED TO BE A SINGLE AGENT FOR ALL USERS TO CONNECT TO.
ONLY USERS OF THIS COMPANION APP WILL BE ABLE TO ADD RAG DOCUMENTS.

THE AGENT WILL READ FROM THIS RAG DB WHEN IT ANSWERS USERS QUESTIONS IN OUR CUSTOMER FACING APPLICATION. 

ALL DOCTORS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE RAG DB FOR ALL CUSTOMERS TO BENEFIT FROM THE UPDATES TO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE. 

WHEN A DOCTOR, A USER OF THIS UPLOADER APPLICATION, LOADS THIS APP, I WANT THE APP TO CHECK IF THE CONTAINER IS RUNNING. 

IF IT IS - THEN WE CONNECT A DOCTOR/USER WITH THE TxAGENT IN THE CONTAINER AND THE AGENT CAN TALK WITH THEM AND THEY CAN TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDING THE DOCUMENT TO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE IN THE CHAT PAGE, OR EMBED NEW DOCUMENTS IN THE UPLOADER PAGE.

IF THE CONTAINER IS NOT RUNNING - THE PAGE WILL SHOW Inactive AS THE STATUS AND THE MONITOR PAGE IS USED TO TROUBLESHOOT THE CONNECTION AND MANUALLY CREATE A CONNECTION TO THE TxAGENT. 

EACH DOCTOR IS TRACKED SO WE KNOW WHO UPLOADED WHICH DOCUMENTS 

THE APP IS 99% THERE I THIINK, BUT - I BELIEVE THAT YOU THINK THAT WE ARE CREATING NEW AGENTS IN THE CONTAINER RATHER THAN JUST CONNECTING TO THE ONE TxAGENT THAT WILL RUN WHEN THE CONTAINER LOADS UP.

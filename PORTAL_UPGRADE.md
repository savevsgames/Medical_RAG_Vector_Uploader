# PORTAL_UPGRADE_PLAN.md (Updated - Phase 2 Complete)

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive integration plan for adding TxAgent Medical RAG capabilities to the existing Doctor's Portal backend. The portal will serve as an intermediary between the mobile user application (SymptomSavior) and the TxAgent container, orchestrating medical consultations, document processing, and multimedia generation.

## System Architecture

```
Mobile App (SymptomSavior)
